## üìò Overview

This project uses five evolutionary algorithms to solve different forms of the Vehicle Routing Problem. Starting with a simple single-depot VRP, the challenges become more complex, involving stochastic, large-scale, multi-objective, and pickup and delivery scenarios.

All implementations are entirely developed in Python, using no external GA libraries, and feature route visualization as well as distance reporting.

## ‚úÖEnvironment Setup

### 1. Python Version

The code was tested on Python 3.13.
Recommended environment:

conda create -n comp5511 python=3.13
conda activate comp5511

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn



 ## ü§îHow to Run Each Task

### Task 1 ‚Äì Classical VRP 

Objective: Reduce overall distance while maintaining capacity (200).

Run:

python task1_vrp.py --csv VRP.csv --out VRP_best.png --seed 42 --gens 2200 --pop 260

Output:

Console summary of route segments, load, and distances

VRP_best.png: visualization of the best route



### Task 2 ‚Äì Stochastic Demand VRP

Objective: Under ambiguous conditions, maximize the anticipated total distance.

Run:

python task2_stochastic_vrp.py --csv VRP.csv --out stochastic_best.png --train-sim 64 --eval-sim 512

Output:

Comparison of deterministic and stochastic results
Feasibility rate and anticipated distance

stochastic_best.png: sampled route visualization



### Task 3 ‚Äì Large-Scale VRP

Goal: Solve a 200-customer VRP with clustering and GA.

Run:

python task3_large_vrp.py --csv VRP.csv --out clustered_routes.png

Output:

Cluster-wise report of distances and loads

clustered_routes.png: all clustered routes visualized



### Task 4 ‚Äì Multi-Objective VRP

Goal:

1: minimize total distance

2: maximize total efficiency (EFF_i - d_i)
Methods: Weighted GA and NSGA-II

Run:

python task4_pareto.py --csv VRP.csv --out pareto.png --verbose

Output:

Weighted GA results for multiple weights

NSGA-II Pareto front

pareto.png: Pareto front + sample routes



### Task 5 ‚Äì Pickup & Delivery VRP

Objective: Minimize total distance while keeping vehicle load within ‚àà [0, 200].
Run:

python task5__pdp.py --csv VRP.csv --out pdp_route.png --pickup-frac 0.3

Output:

Route viability, maximum and minimum loads, and overall distance

pdp_route.png: route + load profile plot



## üëèüèª Implementation Highlights
Task Key Techniques Notes
1 Conventional GA (OX crossover, swap mutation, tournament selection, 2-opt local search) Deterministic starting point
2 Simulation of stochastic demands using Monte Carlo Expected distance = fitness
3 per-region GA optimization combined with K-Means clustering, scalable to more than 200 clients
Four-weighted GA with NSGA-II Efficiency and distance on a Pareto front
5 GA with load constraints, repairability, and penalty. Responds to both positive (delivery) and negative (pickup) requests


## üìä Output and Evaluation

Every task prints:

The optimal route's overall mileage

Details of the load or segments

Pareto or statistical results (for multi-objective and stochastic jobs)

Every run produces a 300 dpi high-resolution PNG figure that summarizes the best path.



## üß™ Recommended Testing

To examine, run each script several times using various random seeds:

Size of the population

Rate of mutation

Rate of crossover

The number of generations

This enables sensitivity analysis for the experimental results section of the report.
